Testing: Increase intake cam degrees at idle, increased airflow = retarded, reduced airflow= advanced?
By airflow I would be watching maf Hz.

I believe I saw this method in one of the VVT tuning threads but I looked for hours last night and was unsuccessful


If you increase it and the airflow goes up then on the intake that would be retard and exhaust advance.
